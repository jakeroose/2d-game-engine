Project description:
Created a Player object via composition that uses WASD to move.
Added collision detection to player & smart sprites.
Added avoidance AI to smart sprites.
Built a HUD that displays controls and toggle-able with F1.
NOTE: I used a placeholder sprite for the smart sprites because it was difficult
  to see the bird sprites that I had before. I most likely won't be using any of
  these sprites for my final game.

The easiest part of this project:
Creating the player.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Getting the collision detection to work properly. It was really difficult trying
to debug to figure out where it was breaking.

Game Level Description:
I would like to create a level where there player is a ball of light/energy and
they have to solve mazes & jumping puzzles while avoiding enemies. The level will
be dark so the player can only see the walls and floor with the light they emit.
They will have to gather more light energies throughout the level to jump higher
to be able to complete the level. The light energies will surround the player so
they will be able to see how many they have.
The score will be based on either how fast they complete the level, how much
light they collect, or a combination of both.
I think I will have 2 kinds of enemies: those attracted to light and those scared
of it. Getting hit will cause you to lose light energy. If you get stuck in an
area there will be some way to suicide and either start at the beginning or at a
checkpoint.
