valgrind --leak-check=full ./run

Lighting:
optimize lighting with GPU or threads
- probably add a lightRenderer class that draws all of the lights at the same time
  instead of one at a time in engine

Player:
gravity
jumping/floating
object collisions

Level:
Simple game level
Game level loader, probably from a text file/JSON file


X calculate lighting for line segments, or maybe add ability to have diagonal rects
  or triangles. not necessary atm.
Cool background. I think falling, rotating squares w/ parallax layers.
