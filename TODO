valgrind --leak-check=full ./run

practice iterator while loops

Collectable:
Should give buff to player


Lighting:
lightRenderer class to render multiple lights at once

Player:
light intensity changes w/ energy left
jumping scales correctly with unitSize

LevelManager:
load collectables from level file

Enemies:
probably move player-wall collision detection into generic class to reuse w/ enemies
(once enemies are added game mechanics are complete I think)

Low Prio:
better XML
Cool background. I think falling, rotating squares w/ parallax layers.
