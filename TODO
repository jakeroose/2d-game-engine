valgrind --leak-check=full ./run

practice iterator while loops

Player:
jumping - in no way is it balanced

LevelManager:
load collectables from level file
load player starting position from file
allow coords to be left<->right and top<->bottom

Enemies:
should walk back and forth on a floor
probably move player-wall collision detection into generic class to reuse w/ enemies
(once enemies are added game mechanics are complete I think)

Low Prio:
better XML
Cool background. I think falling, rotating squares w/ parallax layers.
make first player light a collectable?
smooth changing directions
slowly regain energy

Collectable:
circles around player


Lighting:
More autonomous
- if a light moves then it should automatically update itself. it shouldn't have to be told to update its position and also told to update its polygon. 
- maybe some sort of update queue in light renderer that will notify lights to update themselves.


Things to consider:
object pooling for walls (when levels get larger)
have lights follow player like lerp/slerp
potentially a way to combine lightPolygons so that there is only one pass over 
  the x coordinates of the viewport
tiling background so that it doesn't glitch to hell for tall maps

Bugs:
crashed when hit the ceiling too hard
jumping/flying depends on frame rate
wall coords have to be from top right to bottom left for level loader
