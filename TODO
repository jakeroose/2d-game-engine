valgrind --leak-check=full ./run

look into blitting light polygon shape onto an image to render on GPU
- same with UI elements, seems like sdl primitive draw funcs are super slow
- CUDA example from class

Final Reqs:
music
sound

Polish:
simple introduction level to learn mechanics
more ballanced jumping 
pop-ups to give player directions
have lights follow player via some slerp function (flocking?)
lights don't clip through walls
cancel explosion method

=== End of "Need to Do" ===
Things to consider:
potentially a way to combine lightPolygons so that there is only one pass over
  the x coordinates of the viewport. it is definitely the looping over screen pixels 
  that is causing the lag, not just the draw function
if adding slerp functionality to movement then that will help prevent falling through
  walls durring heavy lag (i.e. valgrind)
player inherit from SmartSprite or other way around
each enemy, collectable, light may need it's own list of walls to compute from?
advanced HUD
- provide hud object with a string or array of strings to display, which it then
  displays and calculates position
- could provide it with a lambda that returns a bool of when it should display or hide
  the HUD so that it could pop up at desired times/locations
- could then have each menu as it's own file in a directory
- compiling another c program https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-call-in-c/
- probs better to use JSON or something instead of reading from multiple files
potentially remove vertices shared by 2 walls. May have to create some massive polygon
  for all connected walls though.
Walls have width (turns out, super easy just need to update collision det.)

Bugs:
jumping/flying depends on frame rate
border walls not added to free walls

Words for title:
vitality - capacity for survival or for the continuation of a meaningful or purposeful existence
labyrinth

multiplayer idea:
players can battle, if they hit each other they both lose energy?
