valgrind --leak-check=full ./run

practice iterator while loops

Collectable:
Should give buff to player
should have light source

Lighting:
lightRenderer class to render multiple lights at once

Player:
light intensity changes w/ energy left
jumping scales correctly with unitSize

LevelManager:

better XML


X calculate lighting for line segments, or maybe add ability to have diagonal rects
  or triangles. not necessary atm.
Cool background. I think falling, rotating squares w/ parallax layers.
