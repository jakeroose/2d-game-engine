Project no: 6

Project due date: 05/02/2018

Project description:
Added "pizazz" to my game.
- dynamic menus / HUD that depend on player state, position, etc.
- music (created by my roommate, Wes Hunter)
- sound (from zapsplat.com)
- options for dynamic lighting but it slows it down even more
- enemies fade based on distance from player
- better sprite for end of level goal

Controls:
F1 - toggle HUD
F2 - toggle debug lines for lighting and walls
F8 - toggle level edit mode
F9 - save level (if in level edit mode)
R  - restart level
P  - pause game
N  - toggle noClip (fly through walls, no gravity)
M  - toggle music
ESC- exit game
Left click (level edit) - place wall vertex
Right click (level edit)- cancel wall placement / remove wall

The easiest part of this project:
The sound was very simple using the code examples provided

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Fixing the lighting. It's so slow due to the number of walls in the large level. It runs fine in the small level. I added multithreading for some of the calculations but I would like it try and implement it in other parts of the light calculation. Currently gets down to ~30 frames on the large, main level. That is after I removed around 100 walls which gave me about 10 FPS back.
