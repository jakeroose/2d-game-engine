Player, Collectable & LevelManager Relationship

Player should only worry about if it has a collectable or not, and should be told when to add or remove a collectable. 

Collectable keeps track of if it's exploding, when it should be drawing the explosion.
Maybe shouldn't have control over whether it is deleted or not. That should probably be handles somewhere else.
I think collectable can have the knowledge of whether or not it's consumed/depleted. From there, engine and levelManager can update it.

LevelManager keeps track of valid collectables and un-used collectables. It is able to move collectables between the two lists. It does not directly affect the state of a collectable.
